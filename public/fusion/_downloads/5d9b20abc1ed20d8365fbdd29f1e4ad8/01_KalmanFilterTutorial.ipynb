        "This notebook is designed to introduce some of the basic features of SMART FUSION using a single\ntarget scenario and a Kalman filter as an example.\n\n## Background and notation\n\nLet $p(\\mathbf{x}_{k})$, the probability distribution over\n$\\mathbf{x}_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, represent a hidden state at some discrete point\n$k$. The $k$ is most often interpreted as a timestep, but could be any sequential\nindex (hence we don't use $t$). The measurement is given by\n$\\mathbf{z}_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$.\n\nIn SMART FUSION, objects derived from the :class:`~.State` class carry information on a variety of\nstates, whether they be hidden states, observations, ground truth. Minimally, a state will\ncomprise a :class:`~.StateVector` and a timestamp. These can be extended. For example the\n:class:`~.GaussianState` is parameterised by a mean state vector and a covariance matrix. (We'll\nsee this in action later.)\n\nOur goal is to infer $p(\\mathbf{x}_{k})$, given a sequence of measurements\n$\\mathbf{z}_{1}, ..., \\mathbf{z}_{k}$, (which we'll write as $\\mathbf{z}_{1:k}$). In\ngeneral $\\mathbf{z}$ can include clutter and false alarms. We'll defer those complications\nto later tutorials and assume, for the moment, that all measurements are generated by a target,\nand that detecting the target at each timestep is certain ($p_d = 1$ and\n$p_{fa} = 0$).\n\n### Prediction\n\nWe proceed under the Markovian assumption that $p(\\mathbf{x}_k) = \\int_{-\\infty} ^{\\infty}\np(\\mathbf{x}_k|\\mathbf{x}_{k-1}) p(\\mathbf{x}_{k-1}) d \\mathbf{x}_{k-1}$, meaning that the\ndistribution over the state of an object at time $k$ can be predicted entirely from its\nstate at previous time $k-1$. If our understanding of $p(\\mathbf{x}_{k-1})$ was\ninformed by a series of measurements up to and including timestep $k-1$, we can write\n\n\\begin{align}p(\\mathbf{x}_k|\\mathbf{z}_{1:k-1}) =\n          \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(\\mathbf{x}_k|\\mathbf{x}_{k-1})\n          p(\\mathbf{x}_{k-1}|\\mathbf{z}_{1:k-1})d \\mathbf{x}_{k-1}\\end{align}\n\nThis is known as the *Chapman-Kolmogorov* equation. In SMART FUSION we refer to this process as\n*prediction* and to an object that undertakes it as a :class:`~.Predictor`. A predictor requires\na *state transition model*, namely a function which undertakes\n$\\mathbf{x}_{k|k-1} = f(\\mathbf{x}_{k-1}, \\mathbf{w}_k)$, where $\\mathbf{w}_k$ is a\nnoise term. SMART FUSION has transition models derived from the :class:`~.TransitionModel` class.\n\n### Update\n\nWe assume a sensor measurement is generated by some stochastic process represented by a function,\n$\\mathbf{z}_k = h(\\mathbf{x}_k, \\boldsymbol{\\nu}_k)$ where $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}_k$ is\nthe noise.\n\nThe goal of the update process is to generate the *posterior state estimate*, from the prediction\nand the measurement. It does this by way of Bayes' rule,\n\n\\begin{align}p(\\mathbf{x}_k | \\mathbf{z}_{1:k}) =\n          \\frac{ p(\\mathbf{z}_{k} | \\mathbf{x}_k) p(\\mathbf{x}_k | \\mathbf{z}_{1:k-1})}\n          {p(\\mathbf{z}_k)}\\end{align}\n\nwhere $p(\\mathbf{x}_k | \\mathbf{z}_{1:k-1})$ is the output of the prediction stage,\n$p(\\mathbf{z}_{k} | \\mathbf{x}_k)$ is known as the likelihood, and $p(\\mathbf{z}_k)$\nthe evidence. In SMART FUSION, this calculation is undertaken by the :class:`~.Updater` class.\nUpdaters use a :class:`~.MeasurementModel` class which models the effect of $h(\\cdot)$.\n\n<img src=\"https://smartfusion.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/predict_update.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Pictorial representation of a single predict-update step\">\n\nThis figure represents a single instance of this predict-update process. It shows a prior\ndistribution, at the bottom left, a prediction (dotted ellipse), and posterior (top right)\ncalculated after a measurement update. We then proceed recursively, the posterior distribution at\n$k$ becoming the prior for the next measurement timestep, and so on.\n\n"

These can be used to\n   represent hidden states, observations, estimates, ground truth, and more.\n2. Bayesian recursion is undertaken by the successive applications of predict and update methods\n   using a :class:`~.Predictor` and an :class:`~.Updater`. Explicit association of predicted\n   states with measurements is necessary. Broadly speaking, predictors apply a\n   :class:`~.TransitionModel`, data associators use a\n   :class:`~.Hypothesiser` to associate a prediction with a measurement, and updaters use this\n   association together with the :class:`~.MeasurementModel` to calculate the posterior state\n   estimate.\n\n"
