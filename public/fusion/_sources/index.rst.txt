SMART FUSION is a framework and pipeline intended to enhance the development, prototyping, and 
evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) object-detection/tracking algorithms.

SMART FUSION is intended to be especially helpful for the following tasks:

- onboarding of new researchers to the vast science of object detection and tracking, 
- designing rigorous testing environments for of object tracking algorithms,  
- combing over primary and secondary literature so that incoming researchers can spend more time pushing SOTA forward (rather than catching up),
- maintaining a catalog of SOTA multisource-multitarget information fusion algorithms and
- providing objective tests intended to aid the assessment and choice of algorithms

SMART FUSION is currently in *beta* and heavily inspired by the `Stone-Soup library`_. Feedback 
and contributions are welcomed to improve the component interface design and grow the number 
components available.

Please see the SMART FUSION :ref:`auto_tutorials/index:Tutorials` for learning
about tracking and using SMART FUSION, :ref:`auto_tutorials/index:Tutorials` for
examples of SMART FUSION features, and :ref:`auto_demos/index:Demonstrations`
for demonstrations of using SMART FUSION.

Installation
------------


.. code::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/claycurry34/Smart-Fusion.git#egg=smartfusion


Developing
^^^^^^^^^^
If you are looking to carry out development with SMART FUSION, you should first
clone from GitHub and install with development dependencies by doing the
following:

.. code::

    git clone "https://github.com/[org_page]/Smart-Fusion.git"
    cd Smart-Fusion
    python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
