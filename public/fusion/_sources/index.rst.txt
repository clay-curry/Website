SMART FUSION is a software research framework geared for supporting advances 
in multisource-multitarget information fusion for multiple object tracking.

As SMART FUSION is focused on development and testing of algorithms, and such
components may not be the most optimised implementations, instead focusing on
being flexible. Its also intended to aid choice of component/algorithms
to tackle real world problems.

The mission of SMART FUSION is to enhance the development, prototyping, and 
testing of algorithms by unifying reusable object oriented code together with 
useful primary and secondary literature, state-of-the-art research, benchmarks, 
and related conference proceedings. SMART FUSION is designed to be especially 
helpful for the following tasks:
* onboarding of new researchers to the vast science of multiple object tracking, 
* designing rigorous testing environments for the assessment of object tracking algorithms,  
* combing-over existing literature so that researchers can spend more time pushing 
state-of-the-art forward (rather than catching up).

SMART FUSION is currently in *beta* and under continuing development, where
feedback and contributions are welcomed to improve the component interface
design and grow the number components available.

Please see the SMART FUSION :ref:`auto_tutorials/index:Tutorials` for learning
about tracking and using SMART FUSION, :ref:`auto_examples/index:Examples` for
examples of SMART FUSION features, and :ref:`auto_demos/index:Demonstrations`
for demonstrations of using SMART FUSION.

Installation
------------
SMART FUSION is currently in *beta* and heavily inspired by the `Stone-Soup library`_.

.. code::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/claycurry34/Smart-Fusion.git#egg=smartfusion


Developing
^^^^^^^^^^
If you are looking to carry out development with SMART FUSION, you should first
clone from GitHub and install with development dependencies by doing the
following:

.. code::

    git clone "https://github.com/[org_page]/Smart-Fusion.git"
    cd Smart-Fusion
    python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

Please also see our :ref:`contributing:Contributing` page.
